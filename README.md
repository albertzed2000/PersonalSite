# Purpose
I build this website using React to showcase my work and gain a deeper understanding of web development. This included learning about
package managers, as well as hosting services and domain name managers. I also discovered a few neat frameworks/libraries
including React-bootstrap, which allowed me to create add in beautiful components such as a Text Carousel as well as helping my website
become mobile-responsive. I also discovered AOS through this project, which allowed me to create fade-in animations.
