        <p>Aside from coding, I have several various interests. As an ex-Chef de Partie at Cactus Club Cafe, I really enjoy
          cooking and learning about the cultural diversity in cuisine. Also, I'd been channeling my passion for exercise to train in order to
          become a lifeguard until I decided to move to Toronto, where I decided to dedicate myself towards running half-marathons. I also
          adore the concept of breathing new life into old clothes, and I've designed several 'avant-garde' garments including
          hand-painted totebags, patchwork thrifted denim, and recolored jackets.
